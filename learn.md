# Squib

Squib is a minimal tweet app created using Django, Django rest framework, and react.js. In this web app users can create tweets, like, retweet, and follow another user.
This is my first full-stack project after completing the Django course on youtube. it's hosted on Heroku. I will add more features quickly. 

**If you want to contribute to this project so feel free to fork it and make a pool request.**

Thank You
